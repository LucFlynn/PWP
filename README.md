## Feedback

I like the use of CSS in your milestone1. Using it for CSS practice was a great idea that I hope paid off.  The purpose audience and goals should easily be accomplished. The persona and use case are well laid out and it is easy to understand who will be using your site and how they will be using it.  Lastly your HTML and directory structure was perfect

## Clarifications 

I would recommend spending a little extra time too refine what exactly you want your social media precense to be and how it will be effected by your portfolio

## Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback
I'm not sure what's going on in the `luc.php` file - But I'm going to base your feedback on the `milestone-2.php` document.

**The content strategy you provided is not sufficient** - what I am looking for here is a short 1-3 sentence description of the content you plan to feature in each section of your layout. Please see [Sample PWP Milestones](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/example/) for an example of what is expected. I feel that if there was a more detailed content strategy here, it would help me understand your wireframes better. 

It seems to me that you're clear on the layout ideas you have for PWP - but I'm afraid that your ideas are not clear to me based on the wireframes alone. I circled back to your Milestone 1 for clarity - and I understand that you intend to use PWP as a traffic-driver and compliment to your social media presence, but I'm not sure how the UI and content you've wireframed  here is supposed to achieve this goal.

That being said - you may be interested in looking into how to use various social media widgets for inclusion in your PWP if you want to feature your updated feeds.  

#### Desktop Wireframe
Here are my questions for you:
- The arrows suggest some kind of dynamic behavior on click that I'm not clear on.
- There are boxes that contain other boxes that are somehow related to your top navigation - I'm not sure what these are intended to represent exactly, or how they behave - but I think they are image thumbnails. Do these image thumbnails (I assume) appear in a pop-up on click? Is that pop-up going to be over on the right hand side like that? Where do they lead or what do they do on click? Perhaps a gallery section in your content region would be a better choice here?
- I'm not sure what the boxes that contain the "episode 1, episode 2, and episode 3" links are supposed to do - I'm guessing that they link to podcasts on another site. The way they are represented in this wireframe they appear to be a child menu of the photo thumbnails.
- How do you propose to load blog entries? Is there a widget that you plan on using, or do you plan to enter and update this content manually? How much length are you planning to feature here? Again, is this a pop-up content area as the arrow seems to suggest?
- I'm concerned that the layout of UI elements is inconsitent visually. It looks a bit haphazard and disorganized from a visual/design standpoint. For instance, the naviagtion menu does not line up with any other elements in any meaningful way.

Answers to each of the questions above are relevant to your development process and the code you'll need to compose to bring these ideas to fruition.  

#### Mobile Wireframe
- First thing, the scale of the mobile wireframe is incorrect and inconsistent (phone layouts are generally not horizontal by default).
- Is each window supposed to represent a separate section of a single page, or a new page view altogether?
- Beware of featuring a horizontal list of links on mobile views since horizontal screen space is limited and highly variable across devices (for example, iPhone 5 vs Google Pixel).
- Again, UI layout is inconsistent.

TL; DR: Remember that wireframes are considered a deliverable to either a client or employer prior to finalizing UI layout and commencing development. If I were an employer, tech lead, or client I would be utterly confused. I'm definielty looking for a more professional level of work here. And most importantly these wireframes are neither consistent nor detailed enough to provide you with a guide for your coding. As a tech lead and instructor I cannot help with development strategy without more clarity regarding your ideas here. I _might_ even be able to even recommend JavaScript/jQuery and CSS tools and a development strategy if I had more clarity in this Milestone.

Also, the HTML in your document is incorrect. Please use the standard HTML structure with all required elements and tags.

Unfortunately I cannot pass this Milestone - it only qualifies for [Tier I](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/) status as it is. Please update your work and circle back with me, George or Mason  by Monday 5/22 at the latest, and I'll bump your grade to [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/) (passing). Slack me this weekend if you can.

Please see [Sample PWP Milestones](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/example/) for some examples.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Please complete the Content Strategy according to the [Milestone 2 Instructions](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/).
- Please use the standards-compliant HTML structure in your `milestone-2.php` document.
- Please update wireframes for clarity and consistency. I strongly recommend using a wireframing tool such as [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/) or [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). 
- Always use the `alt` attribute on `<img>` tags.

### Updated Feedback 5/22
The content strategy is much better. Still your HTML structure is way off - both your `<head>` and `<body>` elements are missing. It may seem like a small thing, but it's really fundamental. 

It looks like the dropdown menu links are radio buttons - I suggest just making them regular links instead of a form input field.

I suggest thinking about how you'd like to display and format your rants in a little more detail. This can affect your HTML structure, and what Bootstrap components you might want to use. Same thing with your Portfolio items. Have a look at the Bootstrap Thumbnail component. Also, on mobile view the thumbnails might be nice 2 by 2... I think you'll have enough horizontal space to accommodate that.

Your contact form will need to have more fields that just the text box. You'll want a name or email field at the very least, a submit button, and there will also be a Google reCAPTCHA field.

I think you have a decent start, but a little more detail in the wireframes would go a long way to help you with a better guide for your development. 

Thanks for making the requested changes to your Milestone. Your Milestone 2&alpha; now passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin development on your PWP. 

### Take note of the following:
- **Build your layout and files directly inside the `/public_html` directory.** I see you have some files outside of the proper directory structure. 
- You should only have one **index.php** file, and all your page sections built on that one page - PWP is not a multi-page site. 
- **mail-config.php** needs to be in your `.gitignore` file - THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. You do not want the sensitive data this file contains publicly available on GitHub! See [PWP Contact Form Instructions](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/jquery-validated-captcha-form/) - I will be demo'ing this in class in the next week or so. 
- Move your **form-validate.js** file into a `/js` directory INSIDE `/public_html`. Again, all project files that are front-end accessible should be inside the /public_html directory.

## Milestone 2b Feedback
Make fixes detailed in feedback left on Slack. Milestone 2&beta; passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).
