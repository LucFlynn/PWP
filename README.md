## Feedback

I like the use of CSS in your milestone1. Using it for CSS practice was a great idea that I hope paid off.  The purpose audience and goals should easily be accomplished. The persona and use case are well laid out and it is easy to understand who will be using your site and how they will be using it.  Lastly your HTML and directory structure was perfect

## Clarifications 

I would recommend spending a little extra time too refine what exactly you want your social media precense to be and how it will be effected by your portfolio
