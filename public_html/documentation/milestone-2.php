    <h1> Content Strategy</h1>

        My site will be multiple pages, and will consist of the following sections:

        Welcome: A brief one-line introduction that clearly states my name and role as a Developer. This welcome message will be at the top. I will have a picture of me on the right side.

        Time line: This section will detail my professional history, core skill set, and professional highlights. This section will showcase my strengths and personality. The tone of voice will be personable and casual, so give a better idea of my personality.

        Portfolio: I will not feature a portfolio on my MVP. Eventually I will have links to other pages that will contain content such as blogs and pictures and a podcast. I will probably start with some generic plug ins to update these things. Something from wordpress or square space to start out with.

        Contact: This section will contain a simple contact form, my professional email address, and additional links to my professional social media profiles: GitHub, StackOverflow, Instagram.

        All the content will be created by me to showcase my life. The goal is to overwhelm people with the amount of work I do on a daily basis by literally showing them. My website will be a hub for the various parts of my life but will allow for people who find me on oen platform, to reach my website, and then find my other platforms.
