        <div class ="emily">
        <img src="css/emily.jpeg">      </div>
		<p> <strong>Name</strong> Emily <br> <strong>Age</strong> 24</p>
		<p> <strong>Profession</strong> <br> She is a manager at Staples, has worked there for 4 years and started out as a cashier then worked her way up. She mainly sits in the back on the computer looking over paperwork and putting out fires. She's sharper than most of her coworkers and employees so most of her job she has largly found ways to automatic or do very efficiently. She is liked well enough by those that matter in her job but she doesn't pout much effort into making great friends with any of them because it's not in her mind that she'll be where she is in another 4 years.  </p>
		<p> <strong>Technology</strong> <br> Like most people her age she uses an iphone. Nobody around her really uses android or anything else. She shells out 1,000 every 2 or 3 years for the new latest model. She mainly uses her phone to text her friends, follow people on social media such as instagram, snapchat and facebook. She posts infrequently but when cool stuff happens she posts. She comments much more and likes more than she posts. She has a macbook air, but doesn't use it for much more than netflix, hulu, and pintrest.  </p>
		<p> <strong>Attitudes and Behaviors</strong> <br> Does what needs to be done regardless of how she feels...but she is more unhappy and unsatisfied than not. She has lots of plans for the future but hasn't made a ton of progress on any of them. SHe just gets up and goes to work even thought she wishes she could get up and live her life. She enjoys working hard but doesn't want her job to feel like a job. She hates the term 'work life balance' because she wants them to literally be one in the same. No balance. Life is work and work is life. Before this however, she needs work she is actually in love with. </p>
		<p> <strong>Frustrations and Needs</strong> <br> She is frustrated at where her life is. Like most milinials she thought she'd be a milionaire by now. She needs the constant motivation of social media to keep her performing at a high level throughout the day.  </p>

        <h2> Use Case </h2>
        <p> Emily, like the vast majority of her contemporaries checks her phone constantly. She loves instagram and twitter and checks them multiple times throughout the day to catch up on her favorite content providers. Anytime she takes a break she pulls out her phones, checks text messages on her phone then flips over to Instagram and twitter. She likes to see people who are accomplishing goals, and working hard for what they want. This motivates her to keep working on her life to achieve her dreams. She would use my profile as a gateway to my instagram and twitter so she could follow me and I could become one of her favorite content creators.  </p>
